## About the Video Course
Are you ready to go on a journey into the world of deep learning? This course will be your guide through the joys and dangers of this new wave of machine learning method. Why? Because,  let’s face it, getting started with deep learning is difficult.Things like choosing between multiple frameworks, understanding APIs and debugging code is not easy. Is there an another way? Yes. Meet PyTorch. Like Python, PyTorch has a clean and simple API which makes building neural networks faster with ease. It’s also modular and that makes debugging your code a breeze. This course will be one hell of an adventure into the world of deep learning!
You will start by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect languages and then translate it using Long-Term-Short Memory (LTSM). Finally, you would channel your inner Picasso by using Deep Neural Network (DNN) to paint unique images. 
By the end of our adventure you will be ready to use Pytorch proficiently in your real-world projects.
